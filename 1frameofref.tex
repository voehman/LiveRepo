\subsection{Frame of Reference}

The model built in this thesis is being built in Matlab and SIMULINK with the tools from the aerospace toolbox. Important to note is that the aerospace blockset sold by mathworks is not used here. At the time of writing no student license used did not include the aerospace blockset, and as others might be in the same position, the simulation model is completed without the blockset.
