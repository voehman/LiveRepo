\subsection{General Model Outline}

A visual representation of the model is shown below in figure \ref{schematic-modeloutline}. This interpretation of the system contains the most important areas and how they depend on eachother for information. This will make it easier to inspect these areas in detail further on.

Since the model should be able to make use of live input from a pilot as well as actual flight data from a timeseries, the schematic is shaded along the logical path of using recorded flight data.
