\subsection{Aerodynamic \& Engine Forces}

The forces and moments section is devoted to the largest parts primaliry giving output in forces and moments. These are the \textbf{Engine} subsystem and the \textbf{Aerodynamics} subsystem, and they are described below in this order.

\subsubsection{Engine System}

The engine system is a subsystem accessible form the top level of the overall system, right next to the aerodynamics system, and is built to take the throttle command, the nozzle pitch command and the nozzle yaw command from the \textbf{Control} subsystem and to output forces and moments generated by the propulsion in effect.

% Add some talk about details like
% 1/0 throttle
% damping
% nozzle and angles, pictures for ease, equations too

\subsubsection{Aerodynamics}

A first aerodynamic model is built. It is however missing some parts so far.


% What is missing from here?
% Delimitations?
