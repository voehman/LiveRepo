\subsection{Aircraft Flight Dynamics}

The fourth and last major part in the top level of the model is the aircraft dynamics part. The subsystem called \textbf{Dynamics} takes the input in terms of forces and moments and outputs the so called \textit{Plant Data} which is then used throughout the model and could be looked at as the current state of the model for the coming timestep. The data collected in \textit{Plant Data} is explained later.
