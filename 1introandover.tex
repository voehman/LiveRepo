\subsection{Overview}

A sub-scale model of an aircraft can be used to test out various scenarios during flight that would be too expensive and dangerous to test out with the real aircraft. It is always a good idea to make a sub-scale model before building the real full scale aircraft. Although a well made sub-scale model is cheaper than a full scale aircraft it is still expensive to build anew if crashed, thus much thought and time is allocated to these models so they are as good as possible at the time they are built. Simulation models in computers can and should be utilized in parallel with the actual flight testing so that a reliable computerized model of the aircraft can be used instead of the sub-scale aircraft while testing new or advanced maneuvers. A goal for acceptable inaccuracy between the recorded flight data and the results from the computer simulation model has to be set by the designer.
