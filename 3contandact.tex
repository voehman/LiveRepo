\subsection{Pilot Control	 \& Actuators}

\subsubsection{Pilot \& Control}

The part of the system named \textbf{Control} is the part of the model where the pilot commands are either created or read, depending on if the model is run with live pilot control or is run with recorded data. The pilot control PWM signals (Pulse-Width Modulation) are the command signals representing specific SI values. Values of which they are translated into immediately in the same model block before they are directed into the \textbf{Actuators} subsystem.

\subsubsection{Actuators \& Servos}

The part of the system named \textbf{Actuators} is the part of the model designed to take values from the \textbf{Pilot \& Control} subsystem and run them through the appropriate  output these commands in thrust and control surface deflection angles deflection
